There are three components in the application.
  1)//Discovery : Client sends the discovery requests to app.
  2)App first checks that whether the device is pingable or not.
  3)if device is pingable save the data in database  and give the response as saved in db.
  4)if not pingble save the data  and send response as ip is not in reach
  5) //Provision :Client sends to provision the discovery  , first check if the discovery is in the table, if yes then set the isprovision filed to true and send the details to plugin.
  6) //Polling: Now App will collect the data of every provisioned device from plugin and dump in the database.
  7) //Polling : Plugin app receives data through zmq from app and then it collects the data and it sends the data back to
            application. Application then dumps the data in database.
  Application periodically sends the requests to plugin for new data collections.and step 7 continues.
